Aim
---
Provide fast 2d graphics using javascript even on slow mobile platforms.

Why?
----
Disapointed by the slow performance of canvas-based 2d libraries on mobile platforms, we needed an alternative. None existed, so Kassics was born.

Kassics is based on pure old-school HTML standards, meaning no Canvas and no WebGL. It runs everywhere and proved to be the fastest way of doing things.

Should you use it?
------------------
It's just a prototype right now, very untested, very undocumented, so I would say no.
